# TestProgram is a simple functional test sequencing demonstration program for sibling project TestLibrary:
  National Instruments™ TestStand™ & Keysight Technologies™ OpenTAP™ are test sequencers; so are TestLibrary/TestProgram, except much less capable.
  
  Sibling project TestLibrary is the necessary companion to TestProgram.
  
  Sibling project TestLibraryTests are basic MSTest unit tests of TestLibrary.
